# BlockChain-Secured-Pet-Website

We have used pure blockchain Technology to make our application Decentralized and Secure. In this application a user can interact with User interface to buy Products From  Ethereum  Wallet .

Also we have used Solidity and javaScript to build this Applicaton .
This README file provides instructions for installing and running the project, as well as an overview of its file structure and variable naming conventions.

# Description
I have developed a decentralized web application using the Ethereum blockchain, Solidity smart contracts, and Web3.js. The application allows users to buy and sell products on the blockchain using a smart contract that manages the backend logic and storage. I have used Truffle as a development framework for Ethereum and Ganache as a personal blockchain for testing and deployment. I have also written JavaScript and Solidity tests for the smart contract using the Chai and Mocha libraries.

The project is a blockchain-based platform for online shopping lovers to create, trade, and collect digital items using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and uses Solidity for smart contract development, along with web3.js for the frontend interface.

# Steps To make Project 
Setting up the development environment
Creating a Truffle project using a Truffle Box
Writing the smart contract
Compiling and migrating the smart contract
Testing the smart contract
Creating a user interface to interact with the smart contract
Interacting with the dapp in a browser



# Usage
This Blockchain Project technology is a powerful tool for securing data storage, verifying transactions, and creating automated agreements. This website helps in creating feedback and providing E-commerce service to users by proving features as  selling and purchasing.  It allows for decentralized networks, transparent transactions, and even asset tokenization. 





# How to use?

Visit the website and Explore E-commerce products.
Register with a valid email ID, password .
Connect Etherium Account & wallet which can be used later for recognition.
Click on Purchase and do Transaction.

# Parts of the project
There are three parts in the project

Breakdown of the different parts of  blockchain project:
Frontend: The frontend of the project is developed using Html, Css, Javascript. This is the client-side of the project that users can see and interact with.

Backend: The backend of the project is developed using Solidity.

Solidity Smart Contracts: Project uses Solidity smart contracts to manage the logic and storage of the platform. The smart contracts handle the buying and selling of products on the blockchain.







# How to run?

Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/Deepanshu7777777/BlockChain-Secured-Pet-Website.git

Open Terminal in Code Editor.

Install Node.js , Truffle , Ganache.

Run cmmd -> npm run dev

The above command will lead to automatically Display the Website .

Once all the installations are done:

**** For Transaction -> Ethereum Wallet is required , if you don't have then make it.****
Once, all the three repositories are up and running:
The Website will run on local Host 3000

# Challenges Comes :

1. Dealing with the complexities of smart contracts and ensuring their security. To address this, it is important to have a strong understanding of Solidity and best practices for smart contract development.

2.•	Another potential challenge is integrating the blockchain technology with front-end user interfaces, such as web applications. This requires knowledge of various technologies such as JavaScript, React, and web3.js.


# Future prospects of the project.

•	Leveraging the potential of blockchain technology to transform other industries, such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management and merging with this Parent Website. 

•	Continuously innovating and adapting to stay ahead of the curve and meet the evolving needs and expectations of users and stakeholders.
