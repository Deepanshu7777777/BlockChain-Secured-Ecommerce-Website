# BlockChain-Secured-Pet-Website

We have used pure blockchain Technology to make our application Decentralized and Secure. In this application a user can interact with User interface to buy Products From  Ethereum  Wallet .

Also we have used Solidity and javaScript to build this Applicaton .
This README file provides instructions for installing and running the project, as well as an overview of its file structure and variable naming conventions.

# Description
I have developed a decentralized web application using the Ethereum blockchain, Solidity smart contracts, and Web3.js. The application allows users to buy and sell products on the blockchain using a smart contract that manages the backend logic and storage. I have used Truffle as a development framework for Ethereum and Ganache as a personal blockchain for testing and deployment. I have also written JavaScript and Solidity tests for the smart contract using the Chai and Mocha libraries.

The project is a blockchain-based platform for online shopping lovers to create, trade, and collect digital items using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and uses Solidity for smart contract development, along with web3.js for the frontend interface.



# Usage
This Blockchain Project technology is a powerful tool for securing data storage, verifying transactions, and creating automated agreements. This website helps in creating feedback and providing E-commerce service to users by proving features as  selling and purchasing.  It allows for decentralized networks, transparent transactions, and even asset tokenization. 





# How to use?

Visit the website and Explore E-commerce products.
Register with a valid email ID, password .
Connect Etherium Account & wallet which can be used later for recognition.
Click on Purchase and do Transaction.






# Register

1. Select Sign in option on top Menu & sign in by Mail or Phone number.
2. For Transctions -> Connect Ethereum Wallet and click on Purchase Item.





# Sign In

Input email ID or Phone no.
Input password
Click on Send OTP to verify 
verify OTP AND THATS ALL
You are Signed In. 







# Dependencies
The project needs the following installations

npm
node js
react js
Ethereum 
Truffle 
Ganache
Vs code Editor or choose any Another Editor.







# Parts of the project
There are three parts in the project

Breakdown of the different parts of  blockchain project:
Frontend: The frontend of the project is developed using Html, Css, Javascript. This is the client-side of the project that users can see and interact with.

Backend: The backend of the project is developed using Solidity.

Solidity Smart Contracts: Project uses Solidity smart contracts to manage the logic and storage of the platform. The smart contracts handle the buying and selling of products on the blockchain.







# How to run?

Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/Deepanshu7777777/BlockChain-Secured-Pet-Website.git

Open Terminal in Code Editor.

Install Node.js , Truffle , Ganache.

Run cmmd -> npm run dev

The above command will lead to automatically Display the Website .

Once all the installations are done:

**** For Transaction -> Ethereum Wallet is required , if you don't have then make it.****
Once, all the three repositories are up and running:
The Website will run on local Host 3000
