# BlockChain-Secured-Pet-Website
We have used pure blockchain Technology to make our application Decentralized and Secure. In this application a user can interact with User interface to buy Products From  Ethereum  Wallet .
Also we have used Solidity and javaScript to build this Applicaton .
This README file provides instructions for installing and running the project, as well as an overview of its file structure and variable naming conventions.

# Description
I have developed a decentralized web application using the Ethereum blockchain, Solidity smart contracts, and Web3.js. The application allows users to buy and sell products on the blockchain using a smart contract that manages the backend logic and storage. I have used Truffle as a development framework for Ethereum and Ganache as a personal blockchain for testing and deployment. I have also written JavaScript and Solidity tests for the smart contract using the Chai and Mocha libraries.
The project is a blockchain-based platform for online shopping lovers to create, trade, and collect digital items using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and uses Solidity for smart contract development, along with web3.js for the frontend interface.


# Usage

Steps 
Setting up the development environment
Creating a Truffle project using a Truffle Box
Writing the smart contract
Compiling and migrating the smart contract
Testing the smart contract
Creating a user interface to interact with the smart contract
Interacting with the dapp in a browser
